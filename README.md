## Purpose 

Article Checker is designed to be a tool for anyone who is writting an important piece of text and wants to have it checked over to see where it can be improved. The app counts and reports times of occurence for each word within a text file. It also spell-checks each word and make recommendations for correcting the wrong spelling.   

### Functionality

Within the app's scope as an MVP functionality includes:  
1. Enable users to pass any text file they want to check to machine by specifying text file path (word count is however limited to 500 per text file).
2. The app analyses repetitions of each word and output the analysis result to a CSV file (eg. "word A, 5")
3. The app checks spelling of each word and recommends correct spelling and the result is output as a CSV file (eg. "wrrd, suggestion:word")
4. User can give any name to the CSV files that store analysis and save CSV files to anywhere in machine based on their own preference. 
5. Built-in error handling procedures to ensure that: 
    a. the file to be checked exists and file path is correct
    b. the type of file to be checked is .txt only.
Dependencies (only covered by Linda Lai template, not sure this is a requirement from rubric)
The Ruby gems 'paint','tty-font', 'net/http' and 'json' are required to run myMDb.
Article Checker returns spelling-cheking data from the Bing Spell Check API (free limit is capped at 5,000 transactions).

## Dependencies

The Ruby gems 'paint', 'artii','tty-font','net/http'and 'dinosaurus' are required to run Article Checker.

API token expires on 01.05.2019. After this date a new token will need to be obtain from [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/try/cognitive-services/?api=text-analytics "Microsoft Azure API").

* After you see the welcome message, you need to provide the file path and file name for your text file. The file name needs to include its extension name.
* If the file path is not provided correctly, the file does not exist or the file extension is not .txt. Error message will appear. And you will be asked to re-enter a file path.

* If the file path and name are provided as required, the program proceeds to enable user to specify the path and file name for the output (csv file)
* Similarly, if the file path or name are not provided as required. The program will continue to ask for the right file path and name.

* If the csv file is successfully created. The program will give a user prompt that indicates 'the csv file has been successfully created'.

## Future Enhancements

* Integration of the Synonym functionality that had not finished implementing.
* Cleaner output of the spellchecking feature by only outputting the mispelled words.
* Audio track for those that are visually impaired.
* Ability for users to search parameters and return 
  * Defintion
  * Synonyms & antonyms
  * Spelling
  * Examples of the word in a sentence
* Acceptance of a wider range of file types
* Ability for the user to choose a file using their GUI



### Accessibility
* Users with a hearing disability will have no problem using this app
* Users with a visual impairment should be able to increase text size and change the font and background colour depending on the terminal program they wish to use, we also recommend a command line screen reader to be used.
* The user will also need to interact with a keyboard to use this app. For those that are visually impaired, we recommend using a large print keyboard or a braille keyboard sticker.
* Future versions of this app will include an audio track for those that are visually impaired.
 

### Potential issues
#### Moral and Ethical
* Using the synonym feature that will be included in the future version of the app could potentially alter facts or direct quotes included in the user's article.
#### Legal
* Considering the situation mentioned above, the user may be deemed responsible for any false claims stated in their article.
#### Cultural and Racial
* This app was originally built for english-speaking users which poses an issue in itself.
* Feature versions of the app will have the ability to detect other languages as well, though we are not in the position to ensure that the synonym feature of this app will work appropriately for those languages and so this is another issue that will arise.
#### Social and Political
* An incorrect use of a word that was suggested by our synonym feature may cause quotes to be politically incorrect.


## Brainstroming

A text editor was used for the initial brainstorming of app ideas. There was discussion of each idea about the limitations, difficulties, extendability, API integration and so on. From here 8 ideas were shortlisted.

Article Checker was the idea chosen and the planning out of building the app continued on Trello from there.

## Task Management
We utilised Trello as our task management software allowing us to define the features, workflow and logic for a minimum viable product. Moreover, we broke down features and itemised tasks to be performed. We also utilised the descriptions and comments on tasks that we broke down, making it very clear what was going on. With Trello workflow was done in a very systematic and organised manner.

### User stories
* As a blogger, I want to be able to spell check my article so that my blog posts look professional.
* As a writer, I want to make sure that I don't use the same words too often so that my book doesn't sound repetitive. 
* As a PhD student, I want to make sure I use a wide range of verbs and adjectives so that my thesis sounds more intelligent.
* As a keynote speaker, I want to have a clear idea of the words I'm using the most, how often the words are used and how many unique word I have so that my speech is intriguing
* As an employee, I want to make sure the emails I write are properly spell checked to avoid embarrassment. 

We started with a simple idea to have a simple text checking tool.
For the MVP version of the software, the only feature we envisaged at the beginning was informing users how many times they had used the same words in their article. Extra features discussed at the planning and scoping stages includes providing synonym to reduce the wordiness of the writing if a word appears too many times, spell-checking the article/essay and suggesting the correct spelling.

Project plan
The following plan for time allocation is determined at Day 1 morning:
Day 1 determine what features that will be available to MVP and an improved product in the future. Complete the coding for MVP.
Day 2 solve the problems left by day 1 for MVP and attempt to add the extra features 
Day 3 finalise the features of the app and improve the UI/UX for the software and complete the documentation and user guide. 

Whiteboard:
1.  List each day's target.
2.  Summarise progress each day.
3.  Layout to-do list or next steps
4.  Drop down all the problems encountered, matched with key words of solution
*  Result visioning: use white board to show how the final result is presented in the csv file.

Project Timeline
*y 1 
Morning is spent on developing a basic desription for each part of program flow for MVP. The end result is shown as below:*    show pic of whiteboard or trello
Afternoon is about actual code writing. The part we spent most of time is to find the right way to remove all non-al*anumeric characters in any text and write code to store result in CSV and output it in a readable format.

other parts of providing user prompt or utilising gems to format the prompt message is less of a challenge. 
At the end of day 1, the MVP is already completed and uploaded to github.

Day 2 
We decided to enhance the MVP by adding two features: spell-checking and synonym suggestions. It becomes obvious that we need to rely and use external API to help us achieve this two features. We spend the morning time to what is the suitable API to use, how to interact with the API and retrieve the data from API call (in JSON file). Finally, we choose bing spell check and oxford dictionary API.

In the afternoon, We started to add API code into our MVP. We are lucky enough to have our spell-check API work almost at the first try. But for synonym suggestion API, we are yet to find a way to make it interact smoothly with our code. The rest of the day is spent on refactoring code, creating handling error code for file path or file name.

Day 3 Solve all the remain problems. Produce the documentation for the program and improve the UI/UX of the app.

Program flow and coding logic
MVP 
The program starts with welcome message, which has been coloured and formatted using two gems. 
Then the program takes in the user input for file path. The two following while loops check whether the file path and file name exist and whether type of file to be checked is .txt. 
After the string from the text file is passed to the machine, a method is used to clean the string (i.e. replace all the non-alphanumerical character with space ' '.)
Then every word within this string is stored as an individual element of an array.
Then the .count method for array is called to count how many times each element appears in this array. By nesting the array index within a while loop, .count method will loop through the whole array and count for each element within the array (i.e all the words within the cleaned string). After that, each word from the cleaned string is converted to the key to a hash and the counting result of its occurence is stored as the value in that hash.
Next step is to prompt the user to provide output file path and file name
Finally, the code is written in such a way that the hash will be converted back to an array. Relying on the do loop, the program takes in every word along with its count number in that array and append them into a CSV file and output the result to local machine.
Extended features:
1. spell check
Bing spell check API is called using the code provided by Microsoft with params 'mkt' set to en-uk (meaning British english). The returned JSON file is parsed and converted into a hash. The result is a array called "flaggedTokens". Then the word incorrectly spelled and its suggested correct form is retrieved and output into the csv file. 
Challenges
1. Free and usable APIs are required for spell-checking and correct spelling and other. To correctly use the API that can achieve our purpose, we spend much time studying 
   how to call the API and interact with API, how to parse the JSON file, and retrieve the information from JSON and pass information to ruby code. Much of this information is beyond our coding kwonledge at this stage. Tremendous amount of time is spent on figuring the right way to use and API and get the result from APIs.
2. A lot of effort has been made in designing the content, format, and file type of output CSV file. Since our analysis result is stored in JSON file or ruby data structure, it    is challenging to retrieve data from these data from ruby structure and store them into CSV file and present them in a readable way to user.  
3. An error handling procedure to prompt user to provide the right path and file name is require for the program work correctly. Error handling deals with interacting with the file system of local machine, a topic that is not covered by the bootcamp course so far. 
Future Enhancements
1. Spelling-checking functions is limited by Bing Spell Check API to maximum of 500 words per text file. To remove this limit, the program needs to be intergrated with 
   Other API
2. If there is a hyphen in a compound word, the app treats the compound as many different word. This will cause a wrong count number given to any compound word.
3. There is no search function for this program. Ideally, the program shall count the word entered by user.
4. Counting functions can count different forms of verbs
Typical User scenario:
A student finishes his school essay. For some reasons, Microsoft word is running super slow /crashes on his/her computer and the student just want to have some quick checks on his writing without spending too much time figuring out whatâ€™s going wrong with Microsoft software. He/she then saves his word file into .txt format and runs this program and get the analysis result for his writing in CSV format. 
The CSV file can be viewed directly by windows notepad or opened by other CSV reader or database file reader if the student feel uncomfortable reading raw CSV file or want to do some further analysis beyond what we can provide in this app.
